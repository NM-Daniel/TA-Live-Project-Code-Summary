# Live Project
## Introduction
As part of my last two weeks at The Tech Academy, I participated in a two week sprint with other students and instructors to develop a C# MVC Web Application. It was a great opportunity to work on legacy code that has had many contributors. During the two weeks we had a sprint planning meeting, daily standups, and code retrospectives. The web application was for a local theater company to manage studio rentals, current productions, and host a blog. I worked in the productions area completing several stories in the <a href="Back End Stories">back end</a> as well as the <a href="Front End Stories"> front end</a>.
